# Frond End Developer Career Path 
## Course by https://scrimba.com

I have started to improve my front end developing skills on Scrimba platform. This Front End Developer Career Path -course aims to teach participiants into a job-ready frontent developer in less than six months. Course includes hundreds of interactive coding challenges with several independently made portfolio projects. 

This repo is for Scrimba-team to tracking my progress and for certification purposes at the end of course. In this repository, I keep my <em>small excercises</em> for Scrimba course, and there will be separate repositorys for each <em>bigger portfolio projects.</em>

Will update this project as I progress.. üòÄ

Excercises so far:

--
### Oldagram - Insta clone

### Blackjack Game
Just another simple excercise with javascript from Scrimba Front End Developer -course.

Uses Math.random() -static method to draw random cards from the deck and keep tracking when exceeding 21. Applies scores so the ace is 11 and jack, queen and king counts as 10. Number cards have their face value.

### Basketball Scoreboard
This JavaScript application keeps track of the scores in a basketball game based on user inputs. User can add 1, 2, or 3 points to either the home or guest side.

Ive also added some "extra features," such as a timer for periods, a highlighted leading team, and some popup windows.

### Hometown Homepage
This is an exercise, and first so called solo project, of Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path.

I Have chosen to make info-page of Helsinki, capital city of Finland. I included some "not needed" features, e.g. favicon and hover effects, and also found a way to implement so called sticky backround. There might be too much code in stylesheet and certainly there is a way to make css shorter.
